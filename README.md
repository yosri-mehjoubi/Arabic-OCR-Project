<h1> Arabic OCR Project 📝🔍</h1> 

<h2> Description</h2> :
Developed an OCR system for recognizing handwritten Arabic words, leveraging advanced deep learning techniques. This project uses a combination of CNN, RNN, and CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) architecture, trained on the IFN/ENIT database, with Word Beam Search decoding to optimize the recognition process.

 <h2> 🚀 Features</h2>:
Recognizes handwritten Arabic words
Utilizes CNN for feature extraction and RNN for sequence learning
CTC layer for handling unsegmented data
Word Beam Search for improved decoding
Trained on the IFN/ENIT database

<h2>🛠️ Technologies Used</h2>:
Python 🐍
TensorFlow or PyTorch (adjust based on your project)
CNN, RNN (LSTM/GRU)
CTC Loss for sequence modeling

<h2>📂 Dataset</h2>:
IFN/ENIT database for handwritten Arabic text.
